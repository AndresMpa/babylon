# Course: JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON (University of Michigan)

This is a course I'm taking in coursera if you are interested in I'm leaving the link [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/javascript-basics) I'm taking this basically because It's easier to learn this way... And what I learn at [MinTic2022](https://github.com/AndresMpa/MinTic_2022) wasn't enough in what basics mean
