# About this course

`useState` is just the beginning of React state management,
we can use `component` or functions with `hooks`, we can
use simple state or complex/compound states, we can even
handle with state in declarative way or imperative way.
All those possibilities allow us to have find the best
possible solution

The aim of this course is to understand those possibilities
also handle with them to achieve the best solutions, it
extends our toolbox.

React, having some states to handle with it
