## Basic

About the basic script we have:

- `next dev` to start a development server
- `next build` to build an app
- `next start` to start next in production
- `next lint` to lint code

By default nextjs also builds using chuck, code splitting and some other
interesting features

> By default nextjs also uses Server Side Rendering SSR, so nextjs is more useful for SEO than React by default
