# Postgres on Node

To use postgres with node we install a module call 'pg' from node-postgres
this module allow us to connect node with postgres (Using docker this process
is easier)

## Docker

To use docker with postgres we use the official image from docker, it can be
used on a Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml I rather .yml files, but it goes
on team, also there's some documentation on image which is pretty useful

### Tip

If there's a problem it's better to remove the volume on docker-compose.yml,
it will be generated by docker-composer everytime but according to documentation
sometimes it can get you into troubles

## Pool vs Client

This is a Singleton on 'pg' module, it helps postgres to connect faster
to our DB also it's easier to use than Client, client starts a new connection
everytime you use it, but Pool doesn't

## pgadmin

This is a service just like phpmyadmin, it's really useful to handle postgres
from containers, but it's a really slow service, take your time, it'll take its
time
