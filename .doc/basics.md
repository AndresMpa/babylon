# About React core

### React for React team

React goal is to be simple

### React for me

React is always leaving traces to make React easier to be use

## Composition

### Maximum proximity

This is a principle that says: "If you are share a state,
use the nearest parent", so the state in that case go from
a children to the closet parent to both components

### Stateful vs Stateless

Stateful components are the components charge of the logic,
in the other hand stateless components are used mainly for UI
